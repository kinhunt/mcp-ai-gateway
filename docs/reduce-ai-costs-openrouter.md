# How to Reduce AI Costs by 80%: Smart Model Routing with OpenRouter

Transform your AI spending from budget-breaking to budget-friendly while maintaining or improving output quality through intelligent model selection.

## Problem Statement

AI costs are spiraling out of control for many users and organizations:
- **Premium models** like GPT-4o and Claude Opus 4 cost $0.03-0.06 per 1K tokens
- **High usage** can easily reach $200-500+ per month
- **Multiple team members** multiply costs exponentially
- **Quality concerns** prevent switching to cheaper alternatives

Meanwhile, many tasks don't require premium capabilities, and new routing services like OpenRouter offer dramatic cost savings through:
- **Free tier models** for simple tasks
- **Bulk pricing discounts** up to 50% off direct API costs
- **Automatic failovers** maintaining reliability
- **Smart routing** to optimize cost vs. quality

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of your current AI usage patterns
- OpenRouter account (free signup)
- Ability to modify MCP configurations
- Basic cost tracking setup

## Step 1: Analyze Your Current AI Spending

### Usage Pattern Assessment

Before optimizing, understand where your money goes:

```markdown
**Current Monthly Breakdown:**
- Premium model usage: ___% of total cost
- Medium complexity tasks: ___% of total cost  
- Simple queries/formatting: ___% of total cost
- Peak usage times: ___ (identify patterns)

**Task Classification:**
High-value tasks (require premium models):
- Complex code architecture
- Critical business decisions
- Advanced creative writing
- Multi-step reasoning

Medium-value tasks (can use mid-tier models):
- Code review and debugging
- Content editing and optimization
- Research and analysis
- Documentation writing

Low-value tasks (can use free/cheap models):
- Grammar checking and formatting
- Simple code snippets
- Basic questions and clarifications
- Template generation
```

### Current Cost Calculation

```bash
# Calculate your baseline
Current monthly spend: $____
Average tokens per month: ____K tokens
Current cost per 1K tokens: $____
Target savings percentage: ____%
```

## Step 2: Set Up Smart Cost Routing

### Tier 1: Free Models (Target: 40-60% of usage)

Configure free tier routing for maximum savings:

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tier 2: Budget Models (Target: 30-40% of usage)

For the rare cases where I fall short, escalate to premium-tier."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tier 3: Premium Models (Target: 5-20% of usage)

```json
{
  "premium-tier": {

What's the cost of getting this wrong vs. right?"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
